        Thank you for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        
        Please note:
        - We consider a problem as PDF++'s bug only if it can be reproducible in the sandbox vault where only this plugin (and other relevant plugins if any) are enabled. You can open the sandbox vault by running "Open sandbox vault" command from the command palette.
        - If this is not the case, ask a question on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus/discussions).
        - As noted in the plugin settings tab, changing some options requires reopening PDF files or reloading the plugin to take effect. If it seems something is not working, first try reopening the vault. If it does not help, please file a bug report.
        - **Please fill in all the fields**. Identifying where the problem comes from is extremely difficult if any of the required fields are missing.
