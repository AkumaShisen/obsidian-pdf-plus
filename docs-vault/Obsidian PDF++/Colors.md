Learn how to customize highlight colors.

## Basics

Recall that you copied a link that looks like the following in the [[Basics|previous tutorial]]:

```
[[Lorem Ipsum.pdf#page=1&selection=4,0,4,11|Lorem Ipsum, page 1]]
```

By default, PDF++ converts this link to a yellow highlight ([[Settings/Backlink highlighting#Default highlight color|related setting]]). To change the color, append `&color=<COLOR NAME>` to the link text. For example,

```
[[Lorem Ipsum.pdf#page=1&selection=4,0,4,11&color=red|Lorem Ipsum, page 1]]
```

The text selection is now highlighted in red.

## Using the color palette

Of course, it is tedious to add a color name to a link manually. By using the color palette added to the PDF toolbar, you can quickly copy a link with a desired color name included.

## Customizing colors

Available colors are defined in [[Settings/Backlink highlighting#Colors|this section in the PDF++ settings]]. See the linked page for further details.
