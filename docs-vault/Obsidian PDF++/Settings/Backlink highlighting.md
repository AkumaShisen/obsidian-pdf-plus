### Highlight colors

> [!TIP]
> Color names can be simply like "Yellow", "Red", ... or more semantic ones like "Note", "Important", "Agree", "Disagree", ...
> 
> The latter is is more robust if you'd like to assign a role for each color because you can change the actual RGB values without breaking the semantics.
