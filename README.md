# Obsidian PDF++ Docs

This branch hosts the official documentation of the [Obsidian PDF++](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus) plugin.

You can view it either [online](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-pdf-plus/) or locally as an Obsidian vault.

## View locally

The vault is located under the `vault` directory. You can open it on your computer as follows.

1. Run the following:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus.git
    cd obsidian-pdf-plus
    git switch docs
    ```
2. In the Obsidian vault switcher, select **Open folder as vault**.
3. Select the `vault/Obsidian PDF++` folder.

## View online

The documentation website is live at https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-pdf-plus/.
The website is generated from the vault using the awesome [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) plugin.
