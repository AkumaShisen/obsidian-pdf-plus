# Obsidian PDF++ Docs

This branch hosts the official documentation of the [Obsidian PDF++](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus) plugin.

You can view it either [online](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-pdf-plus/) or locally as an Obsidian vault.

## View locally

The vault is located under the `vault` directory. To open it on your computer, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus.git
cd obsidian-pdf-plus
git switch docs
```

... and open the folder `vault/Obsidian PDF++` as an Obsidian vault.

## View online

The documentation website is live at https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-pdf-plus/.
The website is generated from the vault using the awesome [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) plugin.
