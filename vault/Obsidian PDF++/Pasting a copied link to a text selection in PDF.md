As you have seen, PDF++ allows us to copy links to specific locations in a PDF file such as pages, annotations, [[Backlink highlighting - Basics|text selections]], [[Embedding rectangular selections|recutangle regions]], scroll positions, sections, and so on.

Of course, you can paste them into markdown files. However, you can also paste them into any text selections in the same PDF file.

For example, right-click on an outline item and select **Copy link to "..."**. Now, you can press `ctrl`/`cmd`+`V` to paste the link to the selected chapter in your note.

What's more, if you select some text in the same PDF file and right-click, you will see a context menu item **Paste copied link to selection**. Click on it.

Then, an internal link to the chapter will be added to the text.
